The source code created in **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional SP1**.
You can easily open the solution in newer versions of Visual Studio.

If you are using **Visual Studio Express** edition, then, unfortunately, will not be so easy.

If you are using **Visual Studio 2010 without Service Pack 1**, then, unfortunately, you can not open the solution file. 
You can install **Service Pack 1** or the latest version of **Visual Studio**, or modify the solution file for **VS2010** without **SP1**.

The main project is located in the **Nemiro.OAuth** folder. 
In other folders are examples.

To test the **ASP.NET MVC** examples requires **ASP.NET MVC 3.0**.

If you get an error message:
*The type or namespace name 'Mvc' does not exist in the namespace 'System.Web'...*

You need to download and install **ASP.NET MVC 3.0**:
http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3

If you have the **ASP.NET MVC 3**, but you still get the above error message, check the target version **.NET Framework**, must be at least 4.0
