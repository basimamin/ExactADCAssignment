If you would rather compile the page as a code-behind with a seperate dll, 
you can deploy it with a simple addition to the web.config of the
target website:

--

<runtime>
  <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
    <probing privatePath="WebFileManager/bin" />
  </assemblyBinding>
</runtime>
